# NexCLI

This project implements a smart CLI command interpreter using natural language processing with Gemini AI. It interprets user input into context-aware Windows commands, ensuring proper path handling, error checking, and file operations. The system also provides detailed explanations for each command, using subprocess to execute them efficiently.
